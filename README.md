HELLO WELCOME EVERYONE!
THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT
IN THIS PROJECT I PLAN TO MAKE A PERSONAL ASSISTANT WHICH CAN BASICALLY DO ANYTHING

CURRENTLY THERE ARE TWO MODULES:
1) FINGER_CONTROL - YOU CAN CONTROL THE MOUSE USING YOUR FINGER. THE RIGHT SIDE OF YOUR SCREEN WOULD CONTROL THE MOVEMENT IE., WHICHEVER INDEX FINGER( FROM TWO HANDS) COMES FIRST AT RIGHT SIDE WILL CONTROL THE
CURSOR WHEREAS THE LEFT SIDE IS FOR CLICK OPERATION YOU MAY JOIN MIDDLE FINGER AND THUMB FOR SINGLE CLICK AND RING FINGER AND THUMB FOR DOUBLE CLICK. YOU CAN USE THIS FUNCTION INDEPENDENTLY TOO AS I HAVE ATTACHED THE
INDIVIDUAL CODES ALSO.
2) VOICE_CONTROL - YOU CAN OPEN YOUTUBE, SPOTIFY OR ANY WEBSITE USING YOU VOICE.... JUST SAY JARVIS OPEN YOUTUBE AND YOUTUBE IS OPENED.

THE MAIN FUNCTION - CURRENTLY I AM WORKING ON THIS FUNCTION, WHAT IS DOES IS IF YOU SAY ACTIVATE ANY MODULE .. EXAMPLE- ACTIVATE FINGER THEN YOU CAN USE THE FINGER_CONTROL MODULE AND SAYING DEACTIVATE FINGER STOPS IT.

MY CURRENT FOCUS IS TO IMPROVE THE MAIN FUNCTION .

IF YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE ABOUT MY PLANS OR CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROJECT PLEASE CONTACT ME.
